# Python Beginners Course

## Python Training Overview

This Python training course leads the students from the basics of writing and running Python scripts to more advanced features such as file operations, regular expressions, working with binary data, and using the extensive functionality of Python modules. Extra emphasis is placed on features unique to Python, such as tuples, array slices, and output formatting.

## Training Prerequisites

Students should already be comfortable using the operating system (Linux, Unix, Windows, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.) on which they will be running Python. While not mandatory, basic skills with at least one other programming language are desirable.

## Hands-on/Lecture Ratio

This Python training class is 70% hands-on, 30% lecture, with the longest lecture segments lasting for 15 minutes. Students "learn by doing," with immediate opportunities to apply the material they learn to real-world problems.

## Python Training Materials

All Python training students receive a copy of O'Reilly's Learning Python and related courseware.

## Software Requirements

* Any Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X operating system
* Link to anaconda insightstack
* Any good text editor (vim and/or emacs recommended under Unix; TextPad, UltraEdit, and vEdit are good for Windows)

## Python Training Objectives

* Master the fundamentals of writing Python scripts
* Learn core Python scripting elements such as variables and flow control structures
* Discover how to work with lists and sequence data
* Write Python functions to facilitate code reuse
* Use Python to read and write files
* Make their code robust by handling errors and exceptions properly
* Work with the Python standard library
* Explore Python's object-oriented features
* Search text using regular expressions
