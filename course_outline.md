# Data Science Course


## Background
The world is quickly being transformed by data-driven insights and prediction algorithms. The basic skills required for data analytics on and off the cloud,  statistical modeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms – span many fields and are not easy to obtain through conventional learning. Come and explore the basic techniques of data science, and algorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering), and basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression). We beleive your analysis workflow should be interactive and achievable using free and Open Source software. 

This course will enable you and/or your teams to become more productive in their analysis workflow and produce visual interactive insights.

All the tools, platforms and software that we use during this course is Open Source and will run on Windows, Linux and Mac. You will even get your own cloud server to interact with during the course. 

## Note
This is not a programming course but programming knowledge will surely be to your advantage. The course will focus mostly on Python and R. You will however see very little of Excel!

We are working on a R and Python spesific programming course. Please be in touch for more detail.


## Duration:  
5 days

## Format:
Instructor lead class with 50% lecture and 50% hands-on labs. Students can bring their own laptops and require either Chrome browser 8.0 or better or Firefox 3.6 or later.


## Course outline

2. Programming (Python,R)
5. Getting, Storing and Cleaning Data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Reproducible Research
6. Statistical Inference
7. Regression Models
8. Practical Machine Learning
9. Developing and Publishing Data Products

## Setting up the Data Scientist’s Toolbox and Environment
Upon completion you will be able to identify and classify data science problems. You will also have created your Github account, created your first repository, and pushed your first markdown file to your account.

## Basic Programming
Overview of data types and objects, reading and writing data,Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times,Loop functions, debugging tools, simulation, code profiling

## Getting, Storing and Cleaning Data
Upon completion you will be able to obtain data from a variety of sources. You will know the principles of tidy data and data sharing. Finally, you will understand and be able to apply the basic tools for data cleaning and manipulation.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
After completing this  you will be able to make visual representations of data using the plotting systems, apply basic principles of data graphics to create rich analytic graphics from different types of datasets, construct exploratory summaries of data in support of a specific question, and create visualizations of multidimensional data using exploratory multivariate statistical techniques.

## Reproducible Research
In this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown or the IPython notebook, integrate live code into a literate statistical program, compile markdown documents using, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.

## Statistical Inference
In this section you will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use  the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.

## Regression Models
You will learn how to fit regression models, how to interpret coefficients, how to investigate residuals and variability.  Students will further learn special cases of regression models including use of dummy variables and multivariable adjustment. Extensions to generalized linear models, especially considering Poisson and logistic regression will be reviewed.

## Practical Machine Learning
Upon completion of this module you will understand the components of a machine learning algorithm. You will also know how to apply multiple basic machine learning tools. You will also learn to apply these tools to build and evaluate predictors on real data.

## Developing and Publishing Data Products
Students will learn how communicate using statistics and statistical products. Emphasis will be paid to communicating uncertainty in statistical results. Students will learn how to create simple web applications of their analysis.
